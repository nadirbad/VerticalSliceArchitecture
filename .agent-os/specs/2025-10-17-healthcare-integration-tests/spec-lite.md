# Spec Summary (Lite)

Remove the deprecated integration test project and establish a modern .NET 9 integration testing infrastructure with WebApplicationFactory, test isolation, and comprehensive coverage of Healthcare API endpoints (BookAppointment, RescheduleAppointment, IssuePrescription). This foundation will enable confident end-to-end testing following vertical slice architecture patterns and serve as a template for future feature testing.
